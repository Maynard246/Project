            <p>Everyone loves a sunset – particularly photographers. But choosing the best camera settings for sunsets can be a challenge, as you want to capture the sun’s colours as they appear to you, not how your camera thinks they should be.
               To this end you need to take control of your exposure and adjust your settings to suit the conditions because in extreme lighting your camera might not interpret the scene in the way you expect.

            <p>The best thing about sunsets is that you're never going to see two that are completely alike. Celebrate those differences by taking in as many sunsets as possible in different places around the world. Watch Mother Nature put on her nightly display from an island in the South Pacific as the sun drops into the ocean, watch daylight turn to dusk from the red rocks of the desert, take in the cotton candy skies from Santorini, or stand on a rocky outcropping as the sun illuminates a centuries-old temple.</p>

            <p>Head to the far northwest corner of the Olympic Peninsula to visit one of Washington State’s most beautiful beaches. Bring your camping gear—getting to Shi Shi requires a trek through the fir-filled forest to the cliff edge that drops into the Pacific Ocean. Hike down the rocky trail to the unspoiled beach lined by tide pools and driftwood stands. Set up camp on the beach to watch the sunset behind the stunning sea stacks and rocky arches for a dramatic Pacific sunset.</p>

         <h1>Famous Sunset In Philippines</h1>
         <p>Sunset views are amazing, romantic, and relaxing. The breathtaking scenery of a sunset turning the sea and the skies into gold can take our problems and stresses away. One of the best spots to watch the sun kisses the sea in the Philippines or probably in the world is at Manila Bay. So when I had the chance to visit our country’s capital city, I made sure that a walk along Roxas Boulevard to catch the sunset was on my itinerary.</p>
